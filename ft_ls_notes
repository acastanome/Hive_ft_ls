• Within your mandatory part you are allowed to use the following functions:
◦ write
◦ opendir
◦ readdir
◦ closedir
◦ stat
◦ lstat
◦ getpwuid
◦ getgrgid
◦ listxattr
◦ getxattr
◦ time
◦ ctime
◦ readlink
◦ malloc
◦ free
◦ perror
◦ strerror
◦ exit

• Its behavior must be identical to the original ls command with variations:
	◦ following options: -l, -R, -a, -r and -t.
		-l:  List in long format. If the output is to a terminal, a total sum for
			all the file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.
		-R: Recursively list subdirectories encountered.
		-a: Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).
		-r: Reverse sort order; reverse lexicographical order or the oldest entries first (or largest files last,
			if combined with sort by size
		-t: Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexicographical order.
	◦ We strongly recommend that you account for the implications of the option -R
		from the very beginning of your code...
	◦ You do not have to deal with the multiple column format for the exit when
		the option -l isn’t in the arguments.
	◦ You are not required to deal with ACL and extended attributes.
	◦ The overall display, depending on each option, must stay as identical as pos-
		sible to the system command. Cordial when grading padding/ pagination,
		but no information can be missing.
